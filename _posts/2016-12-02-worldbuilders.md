[Worldbuilders](https://worldbuilders.org/) is a charity run by one of our favorite authors, [Patrick Rothfuss](http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/index.asp) with an incredible goal: to raise funds for [Heifer International](https://www.heifer.org/), who provide livestock and training to disadvantaged families, providing them with the ability to become self-sustaining and independent.

Each year in December, Worldbuilders raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Heifer. Some incredible authors get involved and donate stuff - mostly books - to a lottery, and everyone who donates at least $10 has a chance to win something from the lottery.

We think it would be awesome if the Ethereum community showed how generous they are by helping out a bit, so we've worked with Worldbuilders to set up a [team page](https://crowdspire.org/campaign/team-ethereum), where any donations to the fundraiser are attributed to the Ethereum community. Right now, only fiat donations are accepted, but we're working with the Worldbuilders team to get them set up with an Ethereum wallet so they can take donations in Ether, too. We've got some neat ideas on how to make that even cooler with giftmatching contracts, and we'd love to hear your ideas along those lines too.

Finally, we're doing our small part to try and encourage people to donate: We'll send a free Ether Card, anywhere in the world, to anyone who donates at least $10 to [Team Ethereum](https://crowdspire.org/campaign/team-ethereum) for Worldbuilders this year. Forward a copy of your receipt to [cards@arachnidlabs.com](mailto:cards@arachnidlabs.com) with an address and we'll send a card out to the person of your choice as a thank you for supporting this amazing charity.

The fundraiser ends December 9, so we don't have a lot of time - let's show people how awesome the Ethereum community can be.
